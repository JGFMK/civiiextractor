I wrote this VB.NET code back around 2003. The CD long since stopped working - and the Evesham PC I wrote code died long ago. Hence I am reconstructing it from a scanned series of printouts
It was only ever tested on the version I had.
It's what I still consider to be the best game of all time.
There were later Gold/Multiplayer variants too. This code was never tested against that variant.
I bought this game when I lived in the USA and it had Microprose - not Atari.
